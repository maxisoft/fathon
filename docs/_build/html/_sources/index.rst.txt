fathon (v1.3.1)
***************

Current version is available for Linux (x86_64 and ARM64), macOS (x86_64), and Windows (64bit).

Python package for detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and related algorithms.
`fathon` provides five main algorithms, namely

- `DFA` (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)
- `MFDFA` (Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)
- `DCCA` (Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis)
- `MFDCCA` (Multifractal  Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis)
- `HT` (Time-dependent Hurst exponent)

`MFDFA` and `MFDCCA` also provides methods for the mass exponent τ and the multifractal spectrum f(α).

`DCCA` has methods to compute the cross-correlation coefficient ρ_DCCA and the corresponding confidence intervals.
